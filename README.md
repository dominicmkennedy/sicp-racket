# sicp-racket

Solutions to exercises in [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) written in [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org/).

This is a two birds with one stone project, since I’d like to become a bit more familiar with  Racket, and I’ve never actually gone through the SICP.

This will likely not be complete since I may skip around in the book as I feel.
